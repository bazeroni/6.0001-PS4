# MIT OCW 6.0001 Problem Set 4
Three problems utilizing OOP with recursion, classes, inheritance, assertions, and more:

### Part A
Part A is a recursive algorithm that returns the permutations (O/N!) of a given input string.

### Part B
Part B is an improved Caesar Cypher with modular classes and subsequent inheritance that can both encrypt and decrypt messages. 

### Part C
Finally, Part C utilizes Part A's permutation algorithm to build a Substitution Cypher that replaces vowels in a message with a corresponding permutation of vowels.
